# Contributing

Thank you for contributing! 

Preferred workflow
- To add a contributor card(Refer to the README for Detailed Instructions):
  1. Fork the repo and create a branch (e.g., `add-card-yourname`).
  2. Edit only the card template area inside `index.html` (look for the template comments).
  3. Run a local preview (open `index.html` in a browser) and verify your card.
  4. Open a PR using the PR template â€” choose "Card addition" in the checklist.

- To propose a feature or improvement:
  1. Open an issue describing the change, motivation, and any UI/UX screenshots or sketches.
  2. Wait for maintainer approval or feedback on the issue.
  3. Once approved, open a PR that references the issue. Use the PR template and mark it as "Feature / Enhancement".

Rules and guidance
- Do not edit content outside the card template area unless you have maintainer approval.
- Keep changes minimal and focused per PR.
- Validate external links and image URLs before submitting.
- If you're unsure, open an issue first and request guidance.

Maintainers
- Use labels (e.g., `card`, `feature`, `needs-review`) and enforce the issue-first rule for feature work.
- Consider adding CI checks later to auto-validate PR scope and link health.
